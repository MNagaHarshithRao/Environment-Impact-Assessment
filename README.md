# Environment-Impact-Assessment
This project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate **environmental impact scores** using various environmental parameters. The dataset contains **synthetic daily measurements** from the year 2023, including:

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- Air Quality Index (AQI)
- Calculated Impact Score

The project workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning model training, and feature importance analysis.
